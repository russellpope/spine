### Prior narrative (model-authored, not evidence)

## Task

Dogfood the shipped local-harness conventions on spine itself (deepthought handoff 2026-08-19 §1a–h) and close the cross-repo follow-through (§2).

## Conclusions

- go@1 pack is self-enabled on spine (I089); five classes + mutation-go pass under maipipe at the pinned commit.
- First live maipipe seam found four defects, all fixed: region TOML grammar + schema (I091); results line 0 / file "." / severity "warn" and battery env leak (I092).
- Bake-off positive control: hygiene classes catch committed binaries on 3/3 arms (docs/research/2026-08-19-…).
- Checkpoint round-trip, model alternate provenance, routing blind spot (I090) verified; minor follow-ups in I093.
- Cross-repo: maipipe I201 filed; deepthought spine PRD amended; /model-eval runs the binary.

## Next moves

- Owner: push spine (main ahead of origin, unpushed since 2132d89); close herdr team workspace; remove worktree spine-wt-local-harness.
- Owner call on I093 items 3–5 (unconfigured-class stages, --force scoping, D11 value tamper).
- Phase 1 continues: `/grill-with-docs` in maipipe with deepthought's maipipe execution-floor PRD.
